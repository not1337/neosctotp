# A user string consists of the unix user, optionally followed by ':' and
# the prefix sent by the user before the actual token, e.g. if the
# unix user name is 'guest', the token length is 6 digits and the user
# inputs 'test123456', the resulting user is 'guest:test'.
# This allows for multiple tokens for a user.
# The special values for the serial number are:
#  0 the first yubikey found
# -1 the first usb attached yubikey found
# -2 the first nfc attached yubikey found
# -3 the first usb attached yubikey 4 with u2f enabled found
# -4 the first usb attached yubikey 4 with u2f disabled found
